peptide-synthesis-calculator
============================

This small web-app is for @christinewang. It calculates the weight of amino acids needed for peptide synthesis. 

To use, just start typing the amino acid name or code in the autocomplete box. When you have found the amino acid you want, just hit enter. Keep entering all the amino acids that form your peptide. If you need to change the amount of peptide you need to make, or the amino acid/activator equivalency, then just go up to the settings area.
